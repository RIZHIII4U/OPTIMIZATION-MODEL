# TASK – 4: Optimization Model  
## Smart EV Charging Station Location & Capacity Optimization  
### Internship Submission – Rishabrizan Ganesh

## 1. Business Problem Statement

A city wants to install EV charging stations at selected locations.

Each location:
- Has installation cost
- Has maximum charging capacity#
- Serves a specific demand zone

The city has:
- Limited budget
- Minimum total demand requirement

Objective:
Minimize total installation cost while meeting EV charging demand.

## 2. Given Data

Locations Available: 5

| Location | Installation Cost | Max Capacity |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| L1 | 50000 | 40 |
| L2 | 70000 | 60 |
| L3 | 40000 | 30 |
| L4 | 60000 | 50 |
| L5 | 55000 | 45 |

Total Budget Available = ₹2,00,000  
Minimum Demand Required = 120 Charging Units

# Create model (Minimization Problem)
model = pulp.LpProblem("EV_Charging_Optimization", pulp.LpMinimize)

# Installation cost
cost = {
    "L1": 50000,
    "L2": 70000,
    "L3": 40000,
    "L4": 60000,
    "L5": 55000
}

# Capacity
capacity = {
    "L1": 40,
    "L2": 60,
    "L3": 30,
    "L4": 50,
    "L5": 45
}

locations = cost.keys()

# Decision Variables (Binary: Install or Not)
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Install",
                          locations,
                          cat="Binary")

# Objective Function (Minimize total cost)
model += pulp.lpSum(cost[i] * x[i] for i in locations)

# Budget Constraint
model += pulp.lpSum(cost[i] * x[i] for i in locations) <= 200000

# Demand Satisfaction Constraint
model += pulp.lpSum(capacity[i] * x[i] for i in locations) >= 120

model.solve()

print("Status:", pulp.LpStatus[model.status])
print("\nSelected Locations:")

total_cost = 0
total_capacity = 0

for i in locations:
    if x[i].varValue == 1:
        print(i)
        total_cost += cost[i]
        total_capacity += capacity[i]

print("\nTotal Installation Cost:", total_cost)
print("Total Capacity Achieved:", total_capacity)


selected = [i for i in locations if x[i].varValue == 1]
selected_capacity = [capacity[i] for i in selected]

plt.bar(selected, selected_capacity)
plt.title("Selected EV Charging Stations")
plt.xlabel("Locations")
plt.ylabel("Charging Capacity")
plt.show()

## 3. Mathematical Formulation

Decision Variable:
Xi = 1 if location is selected, 0 otherwise

Objective:
Minimize Σ (Cost_i × Xi)

Subject to:

1. Budget Constraint:
Σ (Cost_i × Xi) ≤ 200000

2. Demand Constraint:
Σ (Capacity_i × Xi) ≥ 120

3. Binary Constraint:
Xi ∈ {0,1}
